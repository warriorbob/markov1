The report prompted for a username and password because the stored proc was never created in either the test database or production database.  I just created query embedded in the ssrs report but it means that the prompt is needed for accessing the report (for my own use).  The prompt will go away after the stored proc is created.  This stored proc shows only patients who did take glucose tests within a specified date range.  This way, most of 1,300 patients don’t have to be included in the drop down list.

Here are two screenshots of the report below.  The stored proc is linked to the Case Number Drop Down List Box. (I will change the Case Number to Name, sorry about the incorrect text field).

This report helps Joe Cormack to figure out when a patient has a high glucose count and when he has a low glucose count.  Perhaps, he needs it just to verify that a count of certain glucose tests matches that of the Glucose Result Count report.  If you need a pdf of the report, let me know.  Thank you!
Sorry about bothering you on the topic of offline files.  I made my first attempt at resolving the offline files several months ago and I googled articles on it too.  All the articles led me to the sync center but the button was greyed out.  So, I gave up.  Today, a task forced me to face my inaccessible files again.  This is my second attempt and I didn’t remember what steps I took until I hit the sync center with the greyed out button.  Earlier, I thought that I might take a shortcut by asking you, but there wasn’t any shortcut.

This time, I was guessing that I’m not an administrator of the pc because the button is greyed out.  So, I made myself an administrator of my pc and …voila!  The greyed out button is still greyed out!  But I finally got files synchronized!  No more Xs!
